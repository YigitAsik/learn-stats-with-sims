## Scripts to Teach Inferential Statistics

R and Python scripts to teach inferential statistics concepts.

## Source of Examples

Examples are tweaked or extended in some cases, and are taken mainly from the books that I have studied before:
* Daniel Lakens' <em>Improving Your Statistical Inferences</em>
* Allen Downey's <em>ThinkStats</em> and <em>ThinkBayes</em>
* Tom Faulkenberry's <em>Learn Statistics with R </em>
* Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel's <em> OpenIntro Stats </em>
